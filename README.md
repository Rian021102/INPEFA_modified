# Integrated Prediction Error Filter Analysis (INPEFA)

## Please note, this is not my original work, this work belongs to Gabriel Powericho Luo DaelyView,
whose work, I simply forked from his repository https://github.com/daeIy/PyNPEFA . Please refer his work here, and I think he's done awsome jobs. His work also based on  based on l1 trend filtering algorithm by
    Kwangmoo Koh, Seung-Jean Kim and Stephen Boyd.
    https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/l1_trend_filter.html , please spare time visiting the link I'm sharing here. 

So what's my contribution? Just provided the streamlit application. So you can use this apps easliy and you can use multiple LAS files that automatically processed and the result can be downloaded as csv file. You can access it here:
